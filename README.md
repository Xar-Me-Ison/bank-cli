# **A Goliath National Bank CLI application**

A terrible, CLI bank application that's barely an application. 

It's primarily a HIMYM reference that I decided to do into a command line interface (CLI) in the language of C++, just for fun. 

Because, when somebody asks you, that's what you say you do for fun... write C++.


# Instructions

Anyways, onto the instructions. This project, god call it that, consists of just one C++ file which has everything in it.

The compilation instructions are just a classic `g++ -o 'name.cpp'`, followed by the `./'name'` to run/execute it on the terminal of your choosing.

So to reiterate, like a loop does but without the "re":
- `g++ -o 'name.cpp'`
- `./'name'`

# Licensing

Ye... no much to say here. 

Use it as you wish. It is neither impressive nor good, so copy and paste away at your heart's content. 

I am out.
